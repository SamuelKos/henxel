These files were used for testing how to launch editor after some erronous updates, that were
not detected by ast.parse but which prevents editor from launching.
--> normally one uses some other editor to make fix so that editor starts again.

0a: First, script logs out from current python console session.
0b: Second, script executes couple of shell scripts,
    which are getting the return code of test-launching editor, and the error message.
    This was the hardest part.

If test-launch was not succesful:
1: git stash to revert temporarily to last commit
2: import editor
3: bringing changes back by: git stash pop
4: launch editor.


This finally was working but One got a better approach,
so this is considered as garbage, but is left here as notes.
