Press keys in text-area and look for keysym in terminal. If certain
key gets hijacked by OS before getting keysym, one can mask it, by for example
if such a key would be windows-key, press AND hold some state-changing key
like shift, alt, etc and then try again pressing that windows-key or whatever.

It seems that one should not bind: Shift-somekey but instead
bind: Somekey if that is what it reads in keysym when pressing shift-somekey.
but other state-changing keys are more easy:
like if pressing: ctrl-alt-somekey then bind: ctrl-alt-somekey

Combining keys with mouse events might also work.
